        funded when there is a minimum of $1,
        000 CAD in your account. Note
        that as with any bank transfer, there may be a delay between your
        deposit and the time the funds are in your account.''',

        "resolution": '''Passiv uses real-time data passed through your broker's API and should be correct as long as your brokerage connection is active.
        Some brokerage dashboards show a daily account summary rather than
        real-time data. This is often the case for reports and account
        statements. If you make a change in your brokerage account directly
        instead of through Passiv, such as manually placing an order or
        depositing more funds, it may take a few minutes for Passiv to sync
        the latest data from your account.''' ,
